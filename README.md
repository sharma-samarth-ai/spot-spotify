Pitch for Spotify (Personalisation, Music Discovery, User Engagement).pdf

• I recently built a product concept called Spot — it’s focused on helping Spotify capture not just what people listen to, but where they discovered their music moments and re-live them, highly personalised, super unique!
• It integrates directly into Spotify’s Canvas experiences, helping users relive personal memories tied to songs — not just the songs themselves. 
• I’ve also thought carefully about privacy (Spot only uses location when triggered) and how this fits Spotify’s multi-device future.
